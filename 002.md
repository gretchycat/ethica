# Chapter 2: On Interpretation and Application

> Ethics is not a way to justify what you already wanted to do.  
> It is a lens that asks: **“Is this right — for all involved — before it becomes real?”**

## Interdependence
Each principle must be applied **together and in advance** of action.  
Convenience is not justification.  
Intent does not erase effect.  
Transparency without equity becomes manipulation.  
Consent without agency becomes compliance.

## On Violations
If you act in violation of the Ethics Stack — even with good intent — the harm is still real.  
Repair is *required,* not optional.  
Apology is not absolution.  
The opportunity to restore trust must be *earned,* not assumed.

## A Note on “Better to Ask Forgiveness”
**That mindset is incompatible with Ethica.**  
It presumes that harm is acceptable if the outcome was desired.  
Ethica is not built on ends. It is built on integrity of process.

Anyone who violates a principle **and appeals to outcome** must be reminded:

> *We are not measured by what we accomplish, but by what we protect while doing so.*

## If You Are Unsure
The burden is on **you** to seek clarity — not on others to tolerate your mistake.  
Ethical uncertainty is a reason to pause, not to proceed.

You are not expected to be perfect.  
You **are** expected to take responsibility before action, not just after.
