description: |
  The Book of Ethica presents a bold and modern vision for an ethical life, untethered from outdated traditions or authoritarian morality. Designed as a practical and philosophical guide, it outlines a clear, principle-based system rooted in universal values like consent, transparency, and minimal harm. Written for humanists, skeptics, and critical thinkers, Ethica offers tools for living with integrity in a complex worldâ€”where ethical clarity is more important than ever.
