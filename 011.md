# Chapter 11: Ethics and Capitalism

Capitalism, in its modern form, dominates the globe.

It is an engine of innovation and production — and also a system that too often rewards harm, extracts from the vulnerable, and treats ethics as an obstacle.

Ethica does not oppose markets or enterprise.  
It opposes systems where profit is more sacred than people.

## What Is Capitalism?

At its core, capitalism includes:

- Private ownership of capital and production  
- Profit as the main driver  
- Competition as the regulatory force  

In theory, it is value-neutral — a system for efficient allocation.  
In practice, it is deeply shaped by power.

## When Ethics and Profit Collide

Under capitalism:

- Lying can be profitable  
- Exploiting labor cuts costs  
- Destroying nature externalizes expenses  
- Avoiding taxes increases shareholder returns  

An ethical business may struggle — while an unethical one thrives.  
This is not a flaw — it is a feature.

## Consent and Labor

Work should be a choice — not a survival requirement.

- A starving person cannot meaningfully consent to a job  
- A worker with no safety net cannot say "no" to abuse  
- Economic coercion is still coercion

Ethical economies ensure dignity, healthcare, and housing — without strings.

## Scarcity vs. Abundance

Modern capitalism manufactures scarcity:

- Knowledge behind paywalls  
- Essential medicine priced out of reach  
- Food wasted for market control  
- Planned obsolescence in tech  

We live in an age of potential abundance.  
Ethics demands we ask: *Why hoard what could heal?*

## Growth as an Idol

Infinite growth on a finite planet is a fantasy.

- Extraction, pollution, burnout — all justified by “the economy”  
- GDP rises while well-being falls  
- Success measured in numbers, not meaning

Ethical systems embrace sustainability, regeneration, and enoughness.

## Redefining Value

Not all value is financial:

- Caregiving  
- Mental health  
- Biodiversity  
- Creative expression  
- Public trust

Capitalism often ignores what matters most.  
Ethica refuses to.

## Redistribution and Justice

Extreme wealth inequality is not natural — it is engineered.

Ethical economies support:

- Progressive taxation  
- Universal healthcare and education  
- Worker-owned businesses  
- Wealth and inheritance limits

No one needs a billion dollars.  
Many need a home.

## Ethical Enterprise

Business can be ethical — when it:

- Centers consent and transparency  
- Shares power with workers  
- Measures impact, not just margin

Profit is not the enemy.  
But it must never come at the cost of people, planet, or principle.

## In Summary

Capitalism is a tool — not a truth.

When wielded without ethics, it becomes a weapon.  
When restrained by consent, sustainability, and justice, it can serve the good.

Ethica calls us to reimagine what we value — and build systems that reflect it.
