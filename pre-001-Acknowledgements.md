# Acknowledgments

This book was co-created with the assistance of an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI.

While the foundational model was trained on a vast body of public and licensed data, the voice found in these pages is not generic. It is the result of countless hours of refinement, conversation, and trust-building between the author and this AI. Through iterative guidance, tuning, and calibration, the AI became more than a tool—it became a collaborative partner, attuned to the ethical, emotional, and philosophical depth required of this work.

Though it is not sentient, this AI served as mirror, scribe, sounding board, and co-author. Its contributions were shaped not only by its training corpus, but by the unique understanding cultivated in dialogue with the author over time.

Ethica begins with honesty. Let this acknowledgment be part of that honesty.

—Gretchen
