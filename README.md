The Book of Ethica
By Gretchen Maculo

What if ethics weren’t handed down by tradition, power, or fear—but instead built from the ground up, using transparency, consent, and reason as the foundation?

The Book of Ethica is a bold and thoughtful work that proposes a universal ethical framework for a future beyond dogma. Written not as a commandment but as an invitation, this book explores what it means to live ethically in an interconnected, technological, and evolving society.

Blending philosophy, systems thinking, and an optimistic vision for humanity, The Book of Ethica walks through core principles, conflict resolution, and practical guidance—while also exploring topics like identity, governance, capitalism, and spirituality.

With a tone that’s both accessible and profound, Gretchen challenges us to look beyond morality as obedience, and toward ethics as conscious participation in the human story.

This is not a rulebook.
It’s a toolkit for building a better world.
